title1
'Research Question : What are the top 20 countries with the fastest GDP increase ? Which region contributes the largest number of countries among the top 20 ?'
;

title2
'Rationale : This gives us an insight into the economic growth of countries and regions that are developing rapidly in recent two years.'
;

footnote1
'Malawi has the largest rate at a 443% GDP increase from 2015-2016, followed by Burundi at a 346% increase. Tajikistan ranks at 20th, with a 25% increase in GDP.'
;

footnote2
'The frequency table indicates that 16 out of top 20 countries with the fastest GDP_increase are located in the Sub-Saharan Africa region.'
;

footnote3
'The reason why Sub-Saharan Africa countries have fastest GDP_increase is that their 2015 GDP is at a very low level. Therefore, the potential for those countries to expand their economy in the subsequent year is huge.'

Research Question : What are the top 20 countries with the fastest GDP 
increase ? Which region contributes the largest number of countries among 
the top 20 ?

Rationale : This gives us an insight into the economic growth of 
countries and regions that are developing rapidly in recent two years.

Methodology : Use "proc sort" to arrange the variable "GDP_increase" in 
descending order, and then use the "obs=" option in "proc print" to only 
display the top 20 countries with fastest GDP increase. Use "proc freq" 
to calculate the frequency that each region accounts. 

Limitations : Some countries like Congo(Kinsha) and Zimbabwe have 0 GDP value
in these two years. As a result, the combined dataset contains missing value
for the new calculated variable GDP_increase when "merge" statement is used.

Followup Steps : Handle with missing values.

*******************************************************************************;

title1
'Research Question : Is the mean happiness score significantly different across the 4 major continents in the world ?'
;

title2
'Rationale : This studies the difference in happiness_score index by continents, which reflects a worldwide unequal development in the standard of living.'
;

footnote1
'Side-by-side boxplots indicate the average happiness_scores in America and Europe are higher that in Asia Pacific and Africa.'
;

footnote2
'The multiple comparison procedure (LSD) shows that the difference between the happiness_score in America and Europe is not significant. They both have a higher happiness_score than that in the Asia and Pacific region. The happiness_score in Africa is lower than any of the other major continents.'
;

footnote3
'The levene test indicates the homogeneity of variance assumption is valid by having a p-value at 0.2637. However, several outliers are spotted in the boxplot, and the shapiro test for residuals normality has a p-value at 0.0007. A further step of removing outliers should be considered in order to validate the model.'

Research Question : Is the mean happiness score significantly 
different across the 4 major continents in the world ?

Rationale : This studies the difference in happiness_score index 
by continents, which reflects a worldwide unequal development 
in the standard of living.

Methodology : Use "proc format" to categorize the variable "region" 
into 4 groups including "Europe","Asia and Pacific","America","Africa",
and then use "proc glm" to perform one-way ANOVA on the response 
variable "happiness_score" to check if the mean happiness scores 
between these 4 major continents are significantly different.

Limitations : This dataset only contains information from 157-158 countries
or regions. We do not have information from other places, which might have
a great influence on the conclusion once their data is added. Hence this 
can only be used to roughly predict people's feeling of happiness on a 
global scale.

Followup Steps : Check model assumptions, and if it failed, alternative
models should be considered.

Research Question : Which variables can be used to predict the average 
life expectancy of each country ?

Rationale : This helps us build up a model by which we are able to 
calculate the life expectancy once adequate information is obtained.

Methodology : Use "proc reg" to perform a multiple regression model
to see which independent variables including "Economy__GDP_per_Capita_",
"Alcohol_Consumption","Health","Sanitation","Suicide_Rate" are significant.

Limitations : Missing values are present in some of these variables
for particular countries.

Followup Steps : Handle with missing values.
