title1
'Research Question : What are the top 20 countries with the fastest GDP increase ? Which region contributes the largest number of countries among the top 20 ?'
;

title2
'Rationale : This gives us an insight into the economic growth of countries and regions that are developing rapidly in recent two years.'
;

*
Methodology : Use "proc sort" to arrange the variable "GDP_increase" in descending
order, and then use the "obs=" option in "proc print" to only display the top
20 countries with fastest GDP increase. Use "proc freq" to calculate the frequency
that each region accounts. 

Limitations : Some countries like Congo(Kinsha) and Zimbabwe have 0 GDP value
in these two years. As a result, the combined dataset contains missing value
for the new calculated variable GDP_increase when "merge" statement is used.

title1
'Research Question : Is the mean happiness score significantly different across the 4 major continents in the world ?'
;

title2
'Rationale : This studies the difference in happiness_score index by continents, which reflects a worldwide unequal development in the standard of living.'
;

*
Methodology : Use "proc format" to categorize the variable "region" 
into 4 groups including "Europe","Asia and Pacific","America","Africa",
and then use "proc glm" to perform one-way ANOVA on the response 
variable "happiness_score" to check if the mean happiness scores 
between these 4 major continents are significantly different.

Limitations : This dataset only contains information from 157-158 countries
or regions. We do not have information from other places, which might have
a great influence on the conclusion once their data is added. Hence this 
can only be used to roughly predict people's feeling of happiness on a 
global scale.

title1
'Research Question : Which variables can be used to predict the Happiness_score of a country ?'
;

title2
'Rationale : This helps us build up a model by which we are able to calculate the Happiness_score once adequate information is obtained.'
;

*
Methodology : Use "proc reg" to perform a multiple regression model
to see which independent variables including "GDP","Life_Exp",
"Freedom","Trust" are significant.

Limitations : Missing values are present in some of these variables
for particular countries.
